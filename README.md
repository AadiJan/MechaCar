## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle & AWD provided a non-random amount of variance. Variables ground_clearance and    vehicle_length had the most amount of random variance. 
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
