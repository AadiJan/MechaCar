# MechaCar

## Linear Regression to Predict MPG
* Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
  - Vehicle weight, spoiler_angle & AWD provided a non-random amount of variance. Variables ground_clearance and    vehicle_length had the most amount of random variance. 
Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
  - The slope cannot be zero as the p-value is < 0.05 . 
Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
  - Multiple R-squared:  0.7149 (71%) ,	Adjusted R-squared:  0.6825 (68%). The model predicts 71% of the mpg of MechaCar prototype.
